lili provides a tailored life tracking experience. Where you track yourself in health, mental state, finance, habbits, goals, tasks, events, social life, reminders, journalling, reflecting, milestones and whatever you'd like to track for yourself. A tool you use making daily life a joy.

lili would provide a tailored interface that reflects how you would use the app, wheter you are data hungry providing all details or tapping a predefined button.

## people and personal growth
For some people tracking yourself on every level would give an insight on how you improve yourself over time or how you slowly get into a rut. This allows people to change their habbits or set new goals to improve their mental state over time. 

Also for some people tracking yourself is not an easy step to take in the first place. lili makes how you progress trough life visible, acting as a mirror reflecting you. This is why a tailored experience is key, accessible to anyone. Providing you with information getting to know yourself and acting to improve yourself.

## lili and mental health
Mental health is a big topic, so it is not to be assumed a fix is available. However a majority of issues can be prevented by social life and kindly taking care of yourself. lili  provides a platform that is build around social support for people that struggle with mental health issues. 

Often you don't have data available about yourself that might reveal certain causes. It is sometimes said that social media platforms know more about you in that aspect, and could better predict a breakdown of sorts before anyone else would notice.

lili aims to provide two things, data and socials. It is always up to you, how and what you use or share. 

## connecting people
lili is a platform anyone would use because it is a tool for life, a lifehack of sorts. You tailor everything to your liking and use the app to gain insight trough your life. If you're feeling well, hit a milestone or you're proud accomplishing something, you'd share it. Unnaturally the same thing applies to having a shitty day, feeling down or question life, you'd share it. Right? 

Yes, with lili you would hop on a call with proffessional help, a friend or a stranger and share it. Speak it out to the world, have a talk about it or just be with someone. lili could also detect this in advance, without compromising privacy, and ask you if you would be willing to talk to someone sharing something you struggle with.

## in control
You are in control of your own data, you can use it for yourself and see those sweet statistics. But can also use it to share snippets from your journal, statistics from past week or your mood of the day. You can share this with someone before you have a chat for example, or when lili senses your struggles in life automaticly ask you to share and have a chat about it with a friend, stranger or proffesional help.

As stated previously, most Social Media now a days know more about yourself and have statistics about you, you do not even know yourself. Having this data for yourself can eliminate bad habbits or find causes for them. Sort of enhancing your life by providing information you can act on, getting to know yourself better and deeper than ever before.

lili will grow in features over it's lifetime, being a tool for anyone and any usecase for personal growth. Allowing you to choose parts you want to use or requesting features you'd like, tailoring the experience for yourself it allong the way.
